# Data Mining: Search Engine

This is the second homework of the [Data Mining](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-2021) course at Sapienza University of Rome.

The work is centered on implementation of the **Search Engine** ([Problem_1.ipynb](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/Data-Mining/blob/main/Homework%202/scripts/Problem_1.ipynb)) for [kijiji announcements](https://www.kijiji.it/) (web-page with job positions in Italy) and performing the **Nearest-Neighbor Search** while implementing **shingling, minwise hashing and locality-sensitive hashing** using basic Python ([Problem_2.ipynb](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/Data-Mining/blob/main/Homework%202/scripts/Problem_2.ipynb)) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) ([Problem_3.ipynb](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/Data-Mining/blob/main/Homework%202/scripts/Problem_3.ipynb)).

The specifications of the task assignment for each of the three problems can be found in the accompanying pdf: [task_assignment.pdf](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/Data-Mining/blob/main/Homework%202/task_assignment.pdf). The detalis of the **solution approaches, implementational choices** and **results of the testing procedure** are provided inside Jupyter Notebooks with code.
