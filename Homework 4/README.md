# Data Mining: Graph Learning on Biological Data

This is the fourth homework of the [Data Mining](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-2021) course at Sapienza University of Rome.

The work is centered on the **Node Classification** task of **Graph Learning** while building and comparing two different approaches to modeling: **Node2Vec** embbedings + basic classifier of choice (MLP, SVM, etc.) vs **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** with a subsequent application of the graph **Explainability** technique.

## Biological Data to learn on

**Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI)** files of the [Biogrid] dataset and **Gene–Disease Association (GDA)** data from [DisGeNET](https://www.disgenet.org/downloads).
