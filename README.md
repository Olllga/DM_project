# GAN: generating brushstroke paintings

This is the repository of the project proposed for the course of *Data Mining*.

This work is centered on the idea of **Intrinsic Style Transfer** from the paper by [Reiichiro Nakano, **"Neural Painters: A learned differentiable constraint for generating brushstroke paintings"** (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08410) and [**MyPaintBrushstrokes**](https://www.kaggle.com/reiinakano/mypaint_brushstrokes) dataset.

## Introduction

The core idea behind the Neural Painters technology is to provide **the painter agent** trained to generate the source image as a painting in a stroke-by-stroke fashion as a human artist would do.

```Input: source image.```

```Output: painting of this image by brushstrokes```.

The following **4 source images** have been borrowed from the repository of the original paper and preprocessed to be for testing of the built models and experimenting with the results:
