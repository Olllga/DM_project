# GAN: generating brushstroke paintings

This is the repository of the project proposed for the course of *Data Mining*.

This work is centered on the paper by [Reiichiro Nakano, **"Neural Painters: A learned differentiable constraint for generating brushstroke paintings"** (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08410) and [**MyPaintBrushstrokes**](https://www.kaggle.com/reiinakano/mypaint_brushstrokes) dataset.
