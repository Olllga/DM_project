# Data Mining: Clustering and Feature Engineering

This is the third homework of the [Data Mining](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-2021) course at Sapienza University of Rome.

The work is centered on implementation of the **Clustering** algorithm of choice for the [Steam
Reviews Dataset 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021) while performing data inspection and choosing the best **Feature Engineering** technique to improve performance of the clustering.

## Task Assignment

The specifications of the task assignment can be found in the accompanying pdf: [task_assignment.pdf](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/Data-Mining/blob/main/Homework%203/task_assignment.pdf). 

*Note:* task assignment includes two problems, but only solution of the Problem 1 is uploaded, because the Problem 2 is a theoretical problem, meanwhile the repository is intended to keep the practical exercises exclusively. To get comments regarding Problem 2, don't hesitate to contact me personally.

## Implemetation and Results

For more information on **solution approaches, implementational choices, code structure, experiments, results** and **comments on the plots**, printed below (just to make some spoilers ðŸ˜„), please, first refer to [Problem 1 Report.pdf](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/Data-Mining/blob/main/Homework%203/Problem%201%20Report.pdf) and then get familiar with [```scripts```](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/Data-Mining/tree/main/Homework%203/scripts).
